# Fandom-quiz
# Description:
This is an amazing CLI Fandom Quiz application that I have build. It has a series of question and you are awarded 1 point for every right answer and final score displayed at the end of the game.
# Technologies Used:
 1. Replit
 2. JavaScript (Node JS)
 3. readLineSync npm readlineSync
 4. Chalk
 # Brief:
 In this project, I have used an readlineSync module to read the input from the user, and then an object of questions and answers. 
 To check the answers, I have used loop to keep moving to next questions. For score, I have set a global variable that gets incremented. 
 To beautify it, I have used Chalk module
